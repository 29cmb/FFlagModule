# FFlag Roblox Module
A frontend for my [FFlag API](https://github.com/29cmb/FFlagAPI)

A demo including Nexus Admin can be found in the releases tab

## How it works
FFlags are stored in a database and retreived by the module in [the fflags directory](src/ReplicatedStorage/FFlags), see FFlag API repo for backend stuff

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! If you find any bugs, report them in the issues tab or open a pull request!
